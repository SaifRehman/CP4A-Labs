## What is Appsody

Appsody is an open source project that includes a set of tools and capabilities you can use to build cloud-native applications.

Using a powerful, intuitive CLI, you can develop applications in a continuous, containerized run, test, and debug environment and then build and deploy to Kubernetes.

A core component of Appsody is a set of pre-configured stacks and templates for a growing set of popular open source runtimes and frameworks, including Node.js, Eclipse Microprofile, Quarkus, Spring Boot, and more. These stacks act as a foundation on which to build applications for Kubernetes and Knative deployments.
