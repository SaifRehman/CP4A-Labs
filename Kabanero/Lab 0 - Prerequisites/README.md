# Pre-requisites of Kabanero 

## What is Kabanero ?

Kabanero is an open source project that brings together foundational open source technologies into a modern microservices-based framework. This provides an end-to-end solution that enables you to architect, build, deploy, and manage the lifecycle of Kubernetes-based applications, faster.

Kabanero brings together architecture, development, and operations through the use of integrated collections and application stacks. Architects and operations can include their companyâ€™s standards for aspects like security and build pipelines customized for their developers use.
